## Roadmap
- [ ] Create the structure of the game.
- [ ] Create a graphical interface in SDL2.
- [ ] Implement the min-max algorithm.
- [ ] Implement the alpha-beta pruning.
- [ ] Improve our heuristics.

## Principle
It is a 1v1 game, it is played against our algorithm.
Each player has 14 balls.

### Rules
[...]

### Goal
The goal is to push every ball of the opponent out of the board.
