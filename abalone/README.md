# pave-de-serpents

This program showcases the use of forms in SDL2.

## Principle
There are `n` shaking rectangles that spawn in the window, if they touch the window border the game is lost.
Their direction is inverted when they are clicked on.

## To launch the game
```bash
make dir
make
./bin/main <number of rectangles>
```
