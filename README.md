# isima-project-2024

**[Project website](https://matheothomas.github.io/isima-project-2024) with timeline, documentation, plannings...** (in french)

## Principle
This project was part of our first year of computer science engineering at ISIMA, with the goal of implementing **reinforced learning algorithms**.

First we coded simple programs to refresh our knowledge and prove our capabilities.

Then we coded two board games, [Abalone](https://github.com/matheothomas/isima-project-2024/tree/main/abalone) and [Akropolis](https://github.com/matheothomas/isima-project-2024/tree/main/akropolis), by using the SDL2 library and the C programming language.


## Requirements
- the SDL2 library
- gcc
- git

## Installation
Clone the repo with :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/matheothomas/isima-project-2024
cd isima-project-2024/<project to execute>
```

Details for launching the programs are available with each project READMEs.
